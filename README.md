# Enchantum


Enchantum is a **C++20** library designed to provide faster compile time enum reflection. With Enchantum, you can easily handle enum values, names, bitflag support, and much more â€” all with modern C++ concepts.

**Note** only currently implemented for MSVC. GCC and Clang impl coming soon!

**Note** this was tested on Visual Studio latest version (17.13.6 at that time)
